Lip reading, the process of interpreting spoken language by visually observing the movements of the lips, is 
a skill traditionally used by individuals with hearing impairments to understand speech. With advancements 
in technology, automatic lip reading has emerged as a significant area of research in computer vision and 
natural language processing. The ability to accurately read lips using machines opens up numerous 
applications, including aiding the hearing impaired, enhancing silent communication in noisy environments, 
and improving security systems through speech recognition in surveillance footage.
